== Description

The Unity package contains:

- **The C# Wrapper DLLs:** The C# Wrapper can be used with Unity during play mode to generate content procedurally.

- **The PCGAPI.Editor and PCGAPI.Demo Assemblies:** The PCGAPI.Editor assembly adds editor windows to invoke the C# Wrapper functions and generate content during edit mode.
 
== PCG Windows

=== Overview

The Windows are added to the PCG Menu item.
