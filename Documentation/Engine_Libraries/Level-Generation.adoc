== Description

The Level-Generation library is used to generate levels using a simple generation or the Wave Function Collapse Algorithm.

== Algorithms:

* Simple Generation:
    
    - Steps:
        . Choose a starting position.
        . Choose an axis to spawn nodes (X, Y, Z).
        . Choose a direction to follow on axis (positive/negative).
        . Spawn node on starting positions.
        . Offset next position by node size.
        . Spawn new node on offset position.
        . Repeat until node count is reached.

* Multi Dimension Generation:

    - Steps:
        . Choose a starting position.
        . Choose axes (X, Y, Z) and direction (positive, negative) to use.
        . Spawn node on starting position.
        . Choose a direction on the chosen axes (example: positive X).
        . Offset position by node size on chosen direction
        . If overlap is disabled make sure no node is spawned on position. If a node is spawned chose a different direction and get a new position.
        . Spawn new node on offset position.
        . Repeat until node count is reached or all position are overlapping when overlap is disabled.
        
* Wave Function Collapse:
    
    - Steps:
        . Choose expansion mode Breadth-First Search (BFS) / Depth-First Search (DFS)
        . Choose a starting position.
        . Choose axes (X, Y, Z) and direction (positive, negative) to use.
        . Spawn node on starting position.
        . Chose a number of adjacent nodes.
        . Add adjacent nodes to spawned node.
        . If adjacent node already exists removed adjacent node from pending nodes and spawned node.
        . Add pending adjacent nodes to stack(DFS)/queue(BFS).
        . Add spawned node as adjacent node to pending nodes.
        . Get next element in queue/stack.
        . Repeat until node count is reached or no more pending nodes.
        
[NOTE]
A BFS Expansion creates a more connected maze that expands in a rectangular like shape. A DFS Expansion creates a more linear maze that follows a main path and has some rooms alongside the path.

* Grid 2D/3D Wave Function Collapse.

    - Steps:
        . Choose a starting node in the grid.
        . Spawn node.
        . Choose a number of adjacent nodes.
        . Add adjacent nodes to spawned node.
        . Add adjacent nodes as pending.
        . Get next pending node.
        . Repeat until no nodes are pending.
