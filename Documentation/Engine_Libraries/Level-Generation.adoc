== Description

The Level Generation library is used to generate levels using a simple generation algorithm or the Wave Function Collapse Algorithm.

== Algorithms:

* **Simple Generation:**
    
    - Steps:
        . Choose a starting position.
        . Choose an axis to spawn nodes by passing in a unit vector.
        . Spawn node on starting positions.
        . Offset next position by axis * node size.
        . Spawn new node on new position.
        . Repeat until node count is reached.

* **Multi Dimension Generation:**

    - Steps:
        . Choose a starting position.
        . Choose axes (+/-X, +/-Y, +/-Z) to use.
        . Spawn node on starting position.
        . Choose a random axis (example: positive X).
        . Offset position by node size on chosen axis
        . If overlap is disabled make sure no node is spawned on position. If a node is spawned chose a different direction and get a new position.
        . Spawn new node on new position.
        . Repeat until node count is reached or all position are overlapping when overlap is disabled.
        
* ** 3D/4D Wave Function Collapse:**
    
    - Steps:
        . Choose expansion mode Breadth-First Search (**BFS**) / Depth-First Search (**DFS**)
        . Choose a starting position.
        . Choose axes (+/-X, +/-Y, +/-Z) to use.
        . Spawn node on starting position.
        . Chose a number of adjacent nodes.
        . Add adjacent nodes to spawned node.
        . If adjacent node already exists do nothing else add pending adjacent nodes to stack (DFS) / queue (BFS).
        . Add spawned node as adjacent node to pending nodes.
        . Get next element in queue/stack.
        . Repeat until node count is reached or no more pending nodes.
        
[NOTE]
A **BFS** Expansion creates a more connected maze that expands in a rectangular like shape. A **DFS** Expansion creates a more linear maze that follows a main path and has some rooms alongside the path.

[NOTE]
4D Wave Function Collapse is like generating multiple 3D Wave Function Collapse level with at least one node connected to a different level.

* **Grid 2D/3D Wave Function Collapse:**

    - Steps:
        . Choose a starting node in the grid.
        . Spawn node.
        . Choose a number of adjacent nodes.
        . Add adjacent nodes to spawned node.
        . Add adjacent nodes as pending.
        . Get next pending node.
        . Repeat until no nodes are pending.
