== Description

The Python Wrapper is a collection of files used to call native C++ code using ctypes.

== How it works

The Python wrapper redefines all the exposed enums, callbacks and classes in Python.

It contains multiple modules in the pcg folder which communicates with the C API Dll to call native C++ functions.

== Unit Testing

Unit tests using the pytest framework are added to the root folder and used to compare the Python output to the Golden Values used in the C++ Library
