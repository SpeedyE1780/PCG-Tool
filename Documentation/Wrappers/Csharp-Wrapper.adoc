== Description

The C# wrapper is a class library that allows calling native C++ code using the DLLImport attribute.

== How it works

The library's root namespace is PCGAPI. It redefines all the exposed C++ enums, callbacks and classes in C#.

The PCGEngine static class is used to call the C API functions.

== Unit Testing

A xUnit project is added to compare the Wrapper's output to the Golden Values used in the C++ Library.
